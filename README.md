# Crop-Recommendation
Precision agriculture is a modern farming technique that is used to suggest the farmers the best crop to grow. The suggestion is made using the research data of the soil. This aim of this project is to create a model which recommends the best crop to a farmer when he/she inputs the research data of soil.
